        <div class="intro">
           <p>Coffea arabica, also known as the Arabic coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the coffee and madder family Rubiaceae. <br> Arabica tends to have a smoother, sweeter taste, with flavour notes of chocolate and sugar. They often also have hints of fruits or berries. <br> Robusta, on the other hand, has a stronger, harsher and more bitter taste, with grainy or rubbery overtones.</p>

                <h3>Types of Beans</h3>
                <p>Yes, there’s over 120 varieties of coffee plants and each produces a different type of coffee bean, however the majority of the coffee we consume comes from just two variants, Robusta (also known as Coffea Robusta or Coffea Canephora) or Arabica (Coffea Arabica) or a blend of the two. The two varieties differ in taste, growing conditions, and price.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Types of Grind</h3>
                <p>Here are some general guidelines for choosing the best grind, primarily depending on your brew method. However, your personal preferences will win out in the end. Use these guidelines and adjust the fineness or coarseness of your coffee grinds as your taste buds dictate.

                    Coarse Grind - This larger coffee grind is best for brew methods that involve immersion in water, like a French Press. <br>
                    
                    Medium-Coarse Grind-This slightly smoother but still fairly large coffee grind is ideal to use with most pour-over brewers, like a Chemex. <br>
                    
                    Medium Grind - This sandy-textured coffee grind is one of the most popular grinds, perfect for drip brewing coffee makers and aeropress. <br>
                    
                    Medium-Fine Grind - This grind is like silky sand, but doesn’t stick together and is another excellent choice for most pour-over brewers. That’s why we make this the grind size for all of our ground coffee. <br>
                    
                    Fine Grind - This silky grind is finer than table salt. A fine grind is the perfect choice for espresso machines because it packs together well. <br>
                    
                    Happy Grinding</p>

                <h3>Types of Roast</h3>
                <p>Roasting brings out the aroma and flavor that is locked inside the green coffee beans. Beans are stored green, a state in which they can be kept without loss of quality or taste.The four types of coffee roasts are light roast, medium roast, medium-dark roast, and dark roast. Each of these roast levels has a different aroma, appearance, and flavor. Keep reading to learn all about the four types of coffee roasts!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Decaffinated Coffee</h3>
                <p>Decaf coffee is made from regular coffee beans that go through a process to remove the majority of the caffeine. However, decaffeinated coffee is not completely caffeine free, and EU regulation for decaf coffee is less than 0.3% caffeine.</p>
